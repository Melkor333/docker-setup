* Adding users

you might need the apache2-utils installed to use `htpasswd`.

builtin basic auth in the registry_auth volume sadly doesn't work as this requires the registry to run with https (which isn't the case as traefik does all the ssl).

#+begin_src sh
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/traefik_auth/_data/
htpasswd -B registry.passwd newUser
# This might not be necessary but it seems to be the case
docker container update traefik_traefik

# To create use
htpasswd -cB registry.passwd firstUser
#end_src

* TODO Cleanup existing images
